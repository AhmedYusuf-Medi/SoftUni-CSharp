BMR is short for Basal Metabolic Rate Your Basal Metabolic Rate
is the number of calories required to keep your body functioning at rest, 
also known as your metabolism.

What affects my BMR?
Anything that results in an increase 
to your metabolic rate will increase your BMR.
This includes exercise, stress, fear and illnesses.

Your BMR is relative to body mass, age, weight and height. 
It is also affected by your gender; 
as it widely regarded that men need more calories than women.

BMR formula
There are 2 formulae used to calculate BMR, 
in [kcal / 24hrs] for men and women respectively:

BMR for Men = 66.47 + (13.75 * weight [kg]) + (5.003 * size [cm]) − (6.755 * age [years])
BMR for Women = 655.1 + (9.563 * weight [kg]) + (1.85 * size [cm]) − (4.676 * age [years])

Person - Аge [15-80] , gender, height, weight

Harris Benedict Formula
Once you’ve calculated your BMR, this is then put into the Harris Benedict Formula , which calculates your total calorie intake required to maintain your current weight. This is as follows:

Little/no exercise: BMR * 1.2 = Total Calorie Need
Light exercise: BMR * 1.375 = Total Calorie Need
Moderate exercise (3-5 days/wk): BMR * 1.55 = Total Calorie Need
Very active (6-7 days/wk): BMR * 1.725 = Total Calorie Need
Extra active (very active & physical job): BMR * 1.9 = Total Calorie Need
